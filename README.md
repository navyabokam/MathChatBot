## Overview
This project is a **Math ChatBot** built using Python. The chatbot assists users in solving mathematical problems interactively. It can perform basic arithmetic operations and also integrate advanced mathematical functionalities using libraries like SymPy.

---

## Features
*Basic Arithmetic*: Handles operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*Advanced Math Functions*: Utilizes SymPy for symbolic mathematics, such as:
1. Integration
2. Differentiation
3. Simplification

---
*Interactive User Interface*: Users can interact with the chatbot through a simple command-line interface.
**Technologies Used**
*Python*: The core programming language used.
*SymPy*: A Python library for symbolic mathematics, used for tasks like integration, differentiation, and simplification.
*Hugging Face*: Used for integrating advanced machine learning models, allowing the chatbot to improve responses over time.
